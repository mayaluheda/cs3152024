Traditional theater attempts to describe the chaos of the human condition, but absurdist works dare to enact it. Liza Birkenmeier’s “Grief Hotel” is one of those enactors, a strange, snack-sized play that closes out Clubbed Thumb’s 2023 Summerworks series — a proud incubator for strange plays.","{'main': 'Review: A Drowsy Night at ‘Grief Hotel’', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Heartbroken?
